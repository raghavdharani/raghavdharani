# 💫 About Me:
I build things that help teams make better decisions.<br><br>Most of my work has been on platform and operational products across retail, grocery, and SaaS. These are systems that deal with messy inputs, real constraints, and trade-offs that don’t show up neatly in dashboards. The projects here grow out of those problems, just explored with fewer dependencies and more freedom.<br><br>I’m particularly interested in AI-first products that improve how people think, prioritize, and execute. Not AI as a replacement for judgment, but AI as a way to structure chaos, surface blind spots, and make decisions easier to explain and revisit.<br><br>I also borrow heavily from games. Games are great teachers. Clear rules, meaningful constraints, fast feedback, and systems that reveal their depth over time. I tend to apply that same lens when designing tools, workflows, and product mechanics.<br><br>This GitHub is where I build in public, experiment, and refine ideas that I actually use.<br><br>🧠 Projects at a Glance<br><br>Everything here fits into a few practical buckets.<br><br>📦 Warehouse & Fulfillment Systems<br><br>Experiments inspired by warehouse and retail commerce workflows. Inventory movement, constraints, edge cases, and operational decision-making. These focus on how systems behave under pressure, not ideal conditions.<br><br>🛒 Retail Inventory & Store Operations<br><br>Projects rooted in real retail problems like stock visibility, waste, replenishment, and balancing accuracy with speed across stores and backrooms.<br><br>🧭 Product Roadmapping & Prioritization<br><br>Tools that help turn scattered ideas, requests, and tickets into clearer direction. Theme-based roadmaps, multiple prioritization views, and ways to reason about impact versus urgency without pretending there’s one perfect plan.<br><br>🧠 Decision Tools for Product Teams<br><br>AI-assisted utilities that structure inputs, flag missing context, and make trade-offs easier to reason about. Designed to support judgment, not automate it away.<br><br>🎮 Games & System Experiments<br><br>Small, playful builds like tic-tac-toe with twists. These explore rules, constraints, feedback loops, and system behavior. Surprisingly useful ideas often come from here.<br><br>🚧 Now Building<br><br>Right now, I’m focused on improving how product teams reason about what actually matters.<br><br>That includes:<br><br>Separating perceived urgency from real impact<br><br>Exploring multiple plausible roadmap views instead of a single committed plan<br><br>Designing AI-assisted workflows that fit naturally into tools teams already use<br><br>These projects evolve through use. If something feels awkward, I change it. If it proves useful, I double down.<br><br>🛠 How I Like to Build<br><br>Simple surfaces, thoughtful systems underneath<br><br>AI where it genuinely adds leverage<br><br>Platform thinking over one-off features<br><br>Clear documentation that explains the thinking, not just the output<br><br>🎯 Fun Fact<br><br>I think about products the same way I think about games. If the rules are clear, the constraints are fair, and the feedback makes sense, people usually figure out the rest on their own.
